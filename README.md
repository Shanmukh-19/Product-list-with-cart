## My process

I created three components â€” Product List, Cart, and Order. I designed each component individually and then integrated them to work together.

### Built with

- Angular
- Used Angular Material

### What I learned

This challenge helped me gain experience with service injection, MatDialog from Angular Material, and data migration, along with other key Angular concepts 


### Continued development

I need to focus more on writing reusable code and improving my responsive design skills.
